# Trapped Triangles

Three short openFrameworks programs that perform meaningful interactions between animated triangles and the larger physical triangles which constrain them. Projection mapped onto a geometric structure fabricated from laser cut cortex.


# Getting Started

Requires the ofxPiMapper addon for openframeworks
